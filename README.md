# Netflix Clone Project

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my React-based Netflix clone project! This project is a front-end web application that mimics the core features of Netflix, utilizing the TMDB (The Movie Database) API for dynamic, real-time movie and TV show data. It's designed to showcase my abilities in React development, API integration, and responsive web design, built as part of a school assignment.

## ðŸš€ Features

This Netflix clone includes several key features:

- **Dynamic Data Loading**: Fetch and display movies and TV shows from TMDB API based on different categories and providers.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for TV shows using TMDB's search API.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts for a variety of screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **TV Show Details**: Click on a show's poster to view its detailed page, including descriptions, ratings, and backdrop images.
- **Watchlist Management**: Users can add shows to their watchlist, which is stored in localStorage for persistence across sessions.
- **Provider-based Grouping**: Main page displays top TV shows grouped by providers like Netflix, Crave, Disney, and Apple Plus.
